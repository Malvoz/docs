Pollfish may at all times correlate or associate collected response metadata and collected content data with Data voluntarily submitted by the respondent. 

Furthermore, all data collected and processed by Pollfish, in any manner and form, including response meta-data, all content data (for example the answers of the user), voluntarily sent data and all further analyses pertaining to a survey are and remain at all times Pollfish proprietary material, and are included in Pollfish’s proprietary databases.Pollfish may at all times use, transfer, process, develop and exploit at its sole discretion all elements, data or content included in such Pollfish Databases (including precise location data), for any legal, commercial or other purpose. Pollfish may share, transfer or license, in whole or in part elements, data or content included in Pollfish’s proprietary databases, to third parties such as our client-researchers, app-publishers or other possible Pollfish clients. 

Pollfish may also share, transfer or license such data to marketing companies, advertisers or other ad-serving companies who may use (or further sublicense) the data with the purpose of serving advertisements. Pollfish does not collect and in any case does not share with aforementioned entities any sensitive data such as financial account numbers, Social Security numbers, pharmaceutical prescriptions or medical records.  

Pollfish, does not itself collect (and does not allow third parties to directly collect e.g. via third party cookies), user multi-site or cross-app data through the operation of the Pollfish platform. However, Pollfish may share or licence Pollfish-collected data (as such data are described in detail above and may include Personally identifiable- “PII”- as well as non Personally Identifiable- “Non PII”- information) with third entities which, after having received Pollfish data, may themselves associate them with other data (including multi-site data or cross-app data) previously collected/owned by them or licensed to them by other (non-Pollfish and non-Pollfish-affiliated) sources. Such third-party entities, depending on their business scope, may engage in Online Behavioral and Interest based Advertising,allowing advertisers to infer interests and serve ads to users based on their activity and location over time. Transfer or licensing of Pollfish-collected Data to aforementioned entities (although such transferred/licensed data does not in itself include any cross-app or multi-site data) takes place in compliance with the DAA (Digital Advertising Alliance) and the NAI self-regulatory principles to be found respectively at [http://www.aboutads.info/](http://www.aboutads.info/) and [http://www.networkadvertising.org/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/)

We require these third-party service providers to agree to only use the personal information we provide them for the purpose for which it was provided.
*   We may disclose data collected by us (including Direct Personally Identifiable Data, such as name, e-mail address etc. which the user sends to POLLFISH in order to participate in competitions), if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement activity or other legal process.
