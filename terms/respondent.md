<div id="templateRightMenuBody">

POLLFISH is committed to preserving your privacy. Please read the following privacy policy to understand how we use and protect the information obtained from those participating in our surveys (the “surveys”).

### What is POLLFISH and how does it Work?

Unlike other Services of this kind, POLLFISH provides respondents of our surveys (“users” or “survey respondents”) a detailed account of how POLLFISH works and what sorts of user related data and Info POLLFISH collects, stores and processes. POLLFISH respects your Privacy and is committed to building a relationship of trust and full transparency between POLLFISH and Respondents of its surveys.

Pollfish is an on-line survey platform (“The Service”), through which, anyone (referred to as “Researcher”) may conduct surveys. By registering to Pollfish, the researcher has the opportunity to create a questionnaire (or ask Pollfish to create a questionnaire for him based on specific data), and address the questionnaire to the specific public he targets. Pollfish collaborates with Publishers of applications for smartphones as well as with owners of Websites, in order to have access to users of such applications and/or visitors of Websites and delivers to the researchers the answers to their questionnaires. Respondents of surveys may enter a draw for a prize when completing a survey (if and whenever such a Prize is set by Pollfish or a Researcher).

APPLE, GOOGLE AND AMAZON ARE NOT A SPONSOR NOR ARE INVOLVED IN ANY WAY IN THE DRAWS. NO APPLE PRODUCTS ARE BEING USED AS PRIZES.

We require these third-party service providers to agree to only use the personal information we provide them for the purpose for which it was provided.
*   We may disclose data collected by us (including Direct Personally Identifiable Data, such as name, e-mail address etc. which the user sends to POLLFISH in order to collect prizes), if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement activity or other legal process.

We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of personal information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. Please be aware, however, that this is not a guarantee that such personal information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

If has it comes to your attention anything regarding this issue please contact us immediately.

### GENERAL TERMS AND COMPETITION DRAWS AND PRIZES

There is no charge to participate in a Pollfish survey. Pollfish cannot accept any responsibility for any damage, loss, injury or disappointment suffered by any entrant entering a Pollfish survey or as a result of accepting any prize. Pollfish is not responsible for any technical issues in relation to any telecommunications or internet network included in relation to speed of bandwidth including any injury or damage to entrants or any other person’s device related to or resulting from participation or downloading any materials in a Pollfish survey.

Pollfish may reward surveyed users through participation in various competitions. However, publishers have full control on whether or not their users will have the option to enter into any competition and be prompted for any gifts. The winners of each competition are randomly selected by computer machine and get notified through Pollfish enabled apps/websites. To receive a gift, user has to visit a Pollfish enabled application, enter his/her e-mail and follow the instructions. Competition draw-date might change without any prior notice. The gift of the competition is mapped with a user device and it’s mandatory to use the device and a Pollfish enabled app/website in order to get notified. Gift delivery is responsibility of Pollfish. Only the users that won will be notified at the end of the competition. No gift is exchangeable for cash or any other prize. Uncompleted surveys will be disqualified. Pollfish will endeavor to send prizes within a month of the competition end-date but cannot guarantee this delivery time. Sending e-mail is not proof that we have received your entry. No responsibility can be accepted for entries that are lost or which are not received for any reason. Pollfish reserves a right to disqualify any entrant if it has reasonable grounds to believe the entrant has breached any of the Pollfish rules. In the event that any entrant is disqualified from the Pollfish survey competition, Pollfish in its sole discretion may decide whether a replacement should be selected. In this event any further entrant will be selected on the same criteria as the original entrant and will be subject to these Pollfish rules/terms. If the winner refuses to submit his e-mail more than 5 times he is automatically disqualified. If the winner does not respond in the time-frame of one month after the competition is drawn he is automatically disqualified. Pollfish enabled apps/websites are not responsible for the competition and the delivery of the gifts. Pollfish is only responsible to ensure random competition and prompt winners accordingly.

Please note that the above terms apply for prizes set and delivered by Pollfish itself. Researchers may also set and deliver prizes through the survey process. In such a case it is the Researcher who shall be solely responsible for following due procedures of winner selection and delivery of prizes. As far as Researcher prizes are concerned, the Researcher shall provide the Researcher’s contact details in order for the user/Respondent to be able to directly contact the Researcher for any inquiry about set prizes and their delivery.
