### 1. WHO WE ARE 


Pollfish Inc. is a US company seated at 1460 Broadway New York, NY 10036, USA.  Pollfish operates a Greek Branch (hereinafter “the Branch”) located at Pirri 5 Athens, Attica 11527, GR. 
Pollfish Inc. ("Pollfish" or "we" "our" or "us") owns and controls Pollfish services, and provides access to the Pollfish.com website, at the url: www.pollfish.com and all subdomains under the pollfish.com domain and related properties (the "Website"), software, data and materials accessed via the Website (the "Services" or "Properties").


### 2. OUR SERVICE- GENERAL


Pollfish operates an on-line survey platform, through which a Researcher (the “Researcher” or “You”) may conduct surveys. Pollfish collaborates with Developers of applications for smartphones and or website owners, in order to have access to users of such applications/websites and deliver surveys to targeted users.  


By registering to Pollfish, the Researcher can create a survey questionnaire (or ask Pollfish to create a survey questionnaire for the Researcher based on specific Researcher requests), design and implement his own survey programming strategy and address the survey questionnaires to specific audience segments. The Researcher sets the targeting criteria and Pollfish distributes the surveys to the audience segments which meet the targeting criteria set by the Researcher. In order to identify eligible Survey Respondents whose profile meets the targeting criteria, Pollfish has built and operates its proprietary Database, which consists of Data of members of the audience which may be eligible for a survey. Pollfish distributes the surveys created by the Researcher, collects the survey responses and provides the Researcher with reports (the “<b>Reporting Deliverables</b>”) which consist of: 
(a) The Researcher’s survey questions and the responses to such questions (the “<b>Researcher Survey Data</b>”) 
(b) Certain anonymous statistical and socio-demographic data, as already existing in the Pollfish proprietary Database, pertaining to the statistical and socio-demographic profile of anonymous Survey Respondents who have participated successfully in the Survey Process. (the “<b>Existing Pollfish-Database Data</b>”). 

### 2.1 OUR SERVICE- CHARGES & PAYMENTS


Researchers using standard Services provided through our website platform are charged per completed survey response received. However, a researcher may request from Pollfish more specialized Survey-Services. In the latter case, different charges may apply according to a special agreement, negotiated and concluded between Researcher and Pollfish; the amount owed depends on several criteria. Additional representation types for data collected maybe charged differently.


The fees corresponding to the use of standard services are indicated on our website. Such fees must be prepaid when requesting the survey. VAT, if available, may be added to the fees mentioned in the price list, depending on your location. 


Researchers pay only per completed survey response they receive or, in case of special agreements according to the agreed terms. More specifically, if you want to conduct a more specialized survey the fees shall be agreed upon between Pollfish and Researcher, and a special contract shall be negotiated and concluded between the parties. In the event that such complicated and specialized research is not fully accomplished, you will receive a partial refund equaling the pre-paid value of any non-delivered Surveys.


Invoices are available through the Pollfish Dashboard
Please make sure that you have registered your current e-mail. You will also be asked at the registration stage to submit your VAT number, if you have one, according to your legislation.


If, for any reason, you dispute the transactions related to Pollfish services, you must notify Pollfish immediately in writing. 


Pollfish is entitled to terminate the agreement if you do not pay the relevant costs/fees on time and/or any extra costs (including taxes, such as VAT).


Pollfish reserves the right to change the rates and charge differently for its Services. These changes will not affect the Researcher who has already paid fees for a survey.


The fee (as indicated on our website) must be paid via credit card or debit card or wire transfer or online banking or prepaid card. You may only order surveys if you are considered capable of entering into an enforceable contract in the applicable jurisdiction. You agree to pay in full the prices for the survey that you have ordered either by credit/debit card concurrently with your online order or by other payment means acceptable to Pollfish. If payment is not received by us from your credit or debit card issuer or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us.


You are solely responsible for the payment of any banking and transaction costs. Any additional credit or debit charges that may incur due to the transaction will be paid by you and not by Pollfish.


In order to secure the payments through your credit cards, Pollfish collaborates with certified payment service providers operating according to the provisions of the applicable legislation.


In order for the payment to be accomplished, you are directed to a secure page of the collaborating payment service provider which is linked to Pollfish website. There you register your card details, i.e. the full name of the owner of the card, the card number, the expiry date (month and year) of the card, the security code (verifying the authenticity of the card) imprinted in the appropriate space of the card reserved for the signature of the holder (CVV / VISA or CVC / MC), in order to check the validity of the cards and safely carry out the transaction.


Pollfish does not store the data inserted by you in relation to the number of the card or the card security code verifying the authenticity of the card (for example CVV/VISA or CVC/MC). The payment service provider collaborating with Pollfish controls the data inserted and informs electronically Pollfish, for the approval or the rejection of the transaction.


In case a transaction is rejected, irrespectively of the reason of the rejection (which could be for example default on overdraft, failure of the system of the payment service provider or of the Bank issuing the card) you must ensure the payment, otherwise Pollfish is entitled to block your access to the platform.

Data we collect from Survey Respondents through Pollfish-enabled apps/websites and what Survey Respondent data we may share with you as included in the Reporting Deliverables, are designated in our Survey Respondent Privacy Policy which constitutes part of this Agreement and is located at [https://www.pollfish.com/terms/respondent](https://www.pollfish.com/terms/respondent). You understand and agree that Pollfish may share with you only such data as are designated in the aforementioned Privacy Policy, as may be amended from time to time, and no other.

Ownership of Researcher Survey Data and Survey Programming Strategy. Researcher shall be the exclusive owner of all Researcher Survey Data as defined in Section 2 of this Agreement. For clarity, Researcher shall also be the exclusive owner of any “Survey Programming management” strategy as created and implemented by Researcher and all Intellectual Property Rights thereof. 


<b>Limited License to use the Researcher Survey Data.</b> Researcher grants to Pollfish a perpetual, worldwide, non-revocable, non-exclusive license to access and use the “Researcher Survey Data” solely for the following purposes and under the following limitations: 
1. Pollfish may access, store and process the Researcher Survey Data, in order to be able to monitor the Survey Process and provide its services to Researcher.

### 13. CONFIDENTIALITY

<b>13.1 Definitions.</b> As used in this ToS Agreement, 


(a) “Confidential Information” means any proprietary information, including third party information, disclosed, in whatever tangible form or medium, to the other party, irrespective of whether it is clearly marked “confidential” (or with some other proprietary notice or not) and (ii) all information disclosed orally or otherwise in intangible form by the disclosing party.  Confidential information shall not include any part of such information which:
i) Is in or comes into the public domain in any way without breach of this Agreement by the Receiving party;
ii) Has been independently developed by the Receiving Party without recourse to the Confidential Information;
iii) The Receiving Party obtains or has available from a source other than the Disclosing Party without breach by the Receiving Party of any confidentiality or non-disclosure Agreement; put in force between the Receiving Party and this third source; and/or without breach by this third source, of any confidentiality or non-disclosure Agreement put in force between such third source and the Disclosing Party; 
iv) Is disclosed by the Receiving Party with the prior written approval of the Disclosing Party. 
For clarity, the Researcher Survey Data (excluding the “Derived General Tagging Data), as well as all and any contact data of Researcher Client employees or representatives provided voluntarily by the Researcher Client for the commercial, legal, technical or other communications under this Agreement, shall be treated by Pollfish as Researcher Client’s Confidential Information.
<b>(b) “Disclosing Party”</b> means and refers to either party and all its associate companies, associates, employees, officers, servants, agents or professional advisors (including, without limitation, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors), acting on behalf of such party (“hereinafter referred to, collectively, as “Representatives”), where and whenever such party discloses confidential information to the other party. 
<b>(c) “Receiving Party”</b> means refers to either party and all its associate companies, associates, employees, officers, servants, agents or professional advisors (including, without limitation, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors), acting on behalf of the Receiving Party (“hereinafter referred to, collectively, as “Representatives”) where and whenever such party receives information from the other party. 
<b>13.2 Use of Confidential Information.</b> The Confidential Information will be kept strictly confidential and shall not, without prior written consent, be, whether orally or in writing or by any other means, disclosed, divulged, provided or made accessible to any other person (the term “person/s” as used in this Agreement being broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, partnership and individual as well), either directly or indirectly by the Receiving party or by its agents, representatives, officers, directors, partners, employees or advisors (including, without limitation, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors), in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, <b>and shall not be used by the Receiving party or its Representatives, for any purpose whatsoever other than for the performance of this Agreement (the “Purpose”)</b>. The Receiving party shall disclose the Confidential Information only to such of its directors, employees or representatives as they may need to know the Confidential Information for the Purpose. The Receiving party shall treat the Confidential Information with the same degree of care and with sufficient protection from unauthorized disclosure as the Receiving Party uses to maintain its own confidential or proprietary information. The Receiving party shall ensure that anyone to whom the Receiving party discloses the information complies with this Agreement as if they were the Receiving Party and that they enter into a Confidentiality Agreement with the Receiving party (or directly with the Disclosing party, if the latter so requests) on terms no less protective than those contained in this Agreement. Every party and its Representatives will take all necessary organizational and technical measures to ensure that all Confidential Information is properly safeguarded. In the event that the Receiving Party is required by law, Public Authorities or court order to disclose any Confidential Information to any third party, it shall use its best endeavors: (i) To inform the Disclosing Party of the full circumstances of the disclosure and the Confidential Information to be disclosed (ii) To consult with the Disclosing Party with the aim of taking all possible steps to avoid or limit disclosure and taking those steps where they would not result in significant adverse consequences to the Disclosing Party (iii) To gain assurances in relation to confidentiality from the body to whom the information shall be disclosed (iv) To limit the disclosure and provide only the absolutely necessary Confidential Information as requested by the Competent Authorities, provided, however that any such disclosed information will remain subject to this Confidentiality Agreement.  
<b>13.3 Survival.</b> The Parties’ confidentiality obligations under this <b>Section 13</b> shall survive for 5 years following any termination or expiration of this Agreement, provided that confidentiality obligations with respect to Confidential Information constituting trade secrets shall continue for as long as such Confidential Information shall be eligible for trade secret protection. 


### 14. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS


The past, present and future content of the Properties, including without limitation, copyright works and all intellectual property rights (including Industrial Property rights) such as software, logos, trademarks domain names, designs, graphics, pictures, photos, texts, newsletters, etc and any and all copyright material and all other intellectual property right and/or materials related to the Properties (collectively "Content") are the sole property of Pollfish. Except as stated herein, no rights in or to the Content and/or to the Properties are granted to you.

### 15. PRESERVING CONFIDENTIALITY OF SURVEYS


Pollfish understands that surveys distributed may include sensitive or confidential information about the Researcher’s business and operations (e.g. launching of a new product, marketing strategies etc as such information may be revealed directly or indirectly through the contents of a certain survey), which the Researcher does not want to be made public or become accessible to competitors. Pollfish cannot guarantee that the Respondents will treat such information as confidential and that they will desist from divulging or reproducing it. Therefore, in case your survey contains confidential information you wish to protect, we advise you to draft your surveys accordingly. Here are some indicative steps you could follow, in order to reduce aforementioned risks:


(a) You could consider not using any mark, name, logo or other sign which may identify your Company,


(b) You could use an alternate-test name for the product related to your survey.


Please note that experience has proven that “confidentiality notifications” presented to the Respondent at the end of surveys usually has the opposite effect than the one expected, since Respondents seem to share information flagged as “confidential”, more often than they do with information which is not directly identifiable as confidential or sensitive.


### 16. PRIVACY- GENERAL


Pollfish is GDPR compliant. Pollfish complies with the above legislation and rules, in its capacity as Controller as well as in its capacity as Processor of personal data, as the case may be. 


### 16.1 POLLFISH AND THE GDPR

### 16.2 WHAT DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU- HOW WE USE THEM


Pollfish only collects Registration data about you. If and to the extent that, under a special agreement in writing, you provide Pollfish with any Researcher Personal Data, this Section as well as Appendix A to these ToS will also apply for the processing of such Data.


Pollfish is a U.S. based company, therefore you understand and consent to the processing of your personal data by us in the U.S. We may also from time to time transfer your personal information to other countries outside the United States and make it accessible to our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and third-party service providers internationally. We will protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed.

Your registration information is kept securely and not disclosed to any third party for any reason. Your registration information data may be used for contacting you occasionally (for platform announcements, account activation etc.). 
We may work with third-party service providers to provide maintenance services, data analysis, service hosting, and other services for us. These third parties may have access to or process your personal information as part of providing their contracted services to us.

Pollfish cooperates with reliable cloud hosting service providers. Pollfish cooperates with such cloud hosting providers who are either located within the E.U. (and therefore are obliged to comply with all EU Data Protection Laws and Regulations) or may be located in the US.
