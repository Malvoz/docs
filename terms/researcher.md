Pollfish is an on-line survey platform (“The Service”), through which, any user (referred to as “Researcher” or as “you”) may conduct surveys. By registering to Pollfish, the researcher has the opportunity to create a questionnaire (or ask Pollfish to create a questionnaire for him based on specific data), and address the questionnaire to the specific public he targets. Surveys maybe conducted in a white label basis from time to time according to survey creator needs. Pollfish collaborates with Developers of applications for smartphones and or website owners, in order to have access to users of such applications/websites and delivers to the researchers the answers to their questionnaires. Researchers using standard Services provided through our website platform are charged per completed survey response received. However, a researcher may request from Pollfish more specialized Survey-Services. In the latter case, different charges may apply according to a special agreement, negotiated and concluded between Researcher and Pollfish; the amount owed depends on criteria such as targeting criteria and surveys length. Additional representation types for data collected maybe charged differently. Respondents of the surveys may enter a draw for a prize when completing a survey (if and whenever such a Prize is set by Pollfish or a Researcher). Developers may also incentivize their users in order to participate in the survey.
