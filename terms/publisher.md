### 5\. Types of Surveys & Payment

Two types of surveys may be conducted on Pollfish platform:

1.  #### Basic Surveys

    When a Basic Survey is conducted, Pollfish pays to the developers who register Pollfish in their application/website, a minimum lump sum of approximately $0,30, for each completed survey/questionnaire. This lump sum may change at any time but any such change shall not apply to running or completed surveys but only to future ones. If the survey/questionnaire is not completed or is not valid for any reason, no revenue will be delivered to the developer.

2.  #### Playful Surveys

    When a Playful Survey is conducted, the payment of a fee may vary depending on the extent of the research. The minimum lump sum fee described above does not apply in this case. However, the developer, when installing Pollfish, may disable the Playful Surveys option and accept to adhere only for Basic Surveys.

Furthermore, some surveys require a screening process to detect if a mobile user/website visitor is eligible for taking a survey. If a user fails to pass the screening process then the survey is considered as not completed and no revenue will be delivered to the developer.

In case a payment is owed to the developers, the developers get paid on a monthly base through the payment system and payment channel determined by Pollfish or other agreed method (if such a special agreement is concluded between Pollfish and app-developer). Pollfish may use the services of third party payment systems and solutions (e.g. multi-payment solution hosting entities) in order to effect payments and therefore, developers shall be requested to provide their consent, cooperate and abide by the terms and conditions of such third party entities. If the developer declines to accept the rules and terms and conditions of such third party payment systems, no payment can or shall be able to be effected by Pollfish to the declining developer.

Pollfish, at the request of such third-party entity which shall be responsible to effect payments, may disclose information about you to such third party or may request you to provide all further necessary identifying information about you either to Pollfish or directly to such third-party entity, for purposes of compliance with National, State or Federal laws (e.g. laws concerning foreign asset controls, or other similar procedures prescribed by law). By accepting this document you specifically agree to the above and accept that you shall fully cooperate with Pollfish or such third-party entity, for the reasons stated above.

Pollfish, may from time to time, request from you (the developer) to provide information about your app/website, in order for Pollfish to be able to verify compliance of your app with the terms and conditions of this agreement and in order to verify the sincerity of your registered info and actual operation of your registered app/website. In case you fail to deliver the verification information requested by Pollfish, Pollfish shall have the right to withhold all due payments until the requested verification information is provided by you.

Payments are effected within a two weeks time-frame (Net14), commencing always after the 1st day of each calendar month. If the amount to be paid is less than $30, the payment will be withheld and transferred to the next month, until the amount reaches or exceeds the amount of $30\. You, the developer, are solely responsible for the payment of any banking, commission and transaction costs. Any additional credit or debit charges that may incur due to the transaction will be paid by you and not by Pollfish The developer is responsible for paying all relevant taxes or fees that may arise from this payment and transaction. Pricing, timing and methods of payments may change at any time without prior notice. However, such change will not affect the minimum price of ongoing services; it will apply from the next survey.

Publishers or Networks that use Pollfish with an API integration and not with the standard SDK integration will be paid in Net40.
