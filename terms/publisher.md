### 5\. Types of Surveys 

The following type of revenue generating surveys may be conducted on the Pollfish platform:

1.  #### Basic Surveys

    When a Basic Survey is conducted, Pollfish pays to the publishers who register Pollfish in their application/website, a minimum lump sum of approximately $0,30, for each completed survey/questionnaire. This lump sum may change at any time but any such change shall not apply to running or completed surveys but only to future ones. If the survey/questionnaire is not completed or is not valid for any reason, no revenue will be delivered to the publisher.

2.  #### Playful Surveys

    When a Playful Survey is conducted, the payment of a fee may vary depending on the extent of the research. The minimum lump sum fee described above does not apply in this case. However, the publisher, when installing Pollfish, may disable the Playful Surveys option and accept to adhere only for Basic Surveys.

The following types of non revenue generating surveys are also conducted on the Pollfish Platfom: 

1.  Screening process surveys: 

    Some surveys require a screening process to detect if a mobile user/website visitor is eligible for taking a survey. If a user fails to pass the screening process then the survey is considered as not completed and no revenue will be delivered to the publisher.

2.  #### Demographic information surveys: 

    In order to constantly improve Pollfish platform, and make sure that app users are targeted for surveys that would be relevant to them, giving higher completion rate and reliable results, a survey, collecting demographic information will be shown to app users. The process is simple: users will receive a short demographic survey. Response data will be used to divide them into various demographic groups, based on the information gathered. The benefits are two-pronged; users that are very specifically targeted in apps with almost tailor-made surveys on publisher end, and a more relevant survey audience for Pollfish clients. This survey will not generate any revenue for the Publisher since it is part of survey distribution process. Most of information gathered will be displayed also on the Pollfish developer dashboard in order for publishers to better understand their users.

### 6\. Payment

In case a payment is owed to the publishers, the publishers get paid on a monthly base through the payment system and payment channel determined by Pollfish or other agreed method (if such a special agreement is concluded between Pollfish and app-publisher). Pollfish may use the services of third party payment systems and solutions (e.g. multi-payment solution hosting entities) in order to effect payments and therefore, publishers shall be requested to provide their consent, cooperate and abide by the terms and conditions of such third party entities. If the publisher declines to accept the rules and terms and conditions of such third party payment systems, no payment can or shall be able to be effected by Pollfish to the declining publisher.

Pollfish, at the request of such third-party entity which shall be responsible to effect payments, may disclose information about you to such third party or may request you to provide all further necessary identifying information about you either to Pollfish or directly to such third-party entity, for purposes of compliance with National, State or Federal laws (e.g. laws concerning foreign asset controls, or other similar procedures prescribed by law). By accepting this document you specifically agree to the above and accept that you shall fully cooperate with Pollfish or such third-party entity, for the reasons stated above. Please bear in mind that you (and not Pollfish) are responsible for bearing and paying all requested possible commissions or other transaction costs (banking costs, credit, debit charges etc.), as may be requested by the third party payment system appointed by Pollfish to effect payments and depending on your preferred payment method. Before you start using our Services and calculating your revenues from the use of the Pollfish platform, please check the terms of service of such third-party systems in order to get informed about third party commission rates or other possible costs leading to certain deductions from your final payments. We also note that publishers may at all times visit their account section on the Pollfish publisher Dashboard and state their preferred payment method. Costs and fees deducted from their payment, are analytically indicated therein, based on the publisher’s preferred payment method.

Pollfish, may from time to time, request from you (the publisher) to provide information about your app/website, in order for Pollfish to be able to verify compliance of your app with the terms and conditions of this agreement and in order to verify the sincerity of your registered info and actual operation of your registered app/website. In case you fail to deliver the verification information requested by Pollfish, Pollfish shall have the right to withhold all due payments until the requested verification information is provided by you. Payments are effected within a two weeks time-frame (Net14), commencing always after the 1st day of each calendar month. For publishers generating more than $10.000 (>$10k) payments shall be effected within a fourty five days time frame (Net45) commencing always after the 1st day of each calendar month.. If the amount to be paid is less than $30, the payment will be withheld and transferred to the next month, until the amount reaches or exceeds the amount of $30.

Publishers or Networks that use Pollfish with an API integration and not with the standard SDK integration will be paid in Net45. All Referral prices are displayed in USD and may be found in [https://www.pollfish.com/referral](https://www.pollfish.com/referral). Polllfish Inc. is a registered US company. All publisher payments occur in US currency. Notifications/listeners fired from the SDK within the apps to inform the user about the money to be earned from a survey are delivered in USD.

You, the publisher, are solely responsible for the payment of any banking, commission and transaction costs. Any additional credit or debit charges that may incur due to the transaction will be paid by you and not by Pollfish . You, the publisher are also responsible for paying all relevant taxes or fees that may arise from payments and transactions. You acknowledge that all and any aforementioned costs (e.g. commission fees) shall be deducted from the sum payable to you by Pollfish, according to the terms of such third party payment systems (and depending on your preferred method of payment), for which you are so notified when using the relevant third party payment service and/or visiting the account section on the Pollfish publisher Dashboard.

Pricing, timing and methods of payments may change at any time without prior notice. However, such change will not affect the minimum price of ongoing services; it will apply from the next survey.Pollfish seeks long term relationships with app publishers. Consequently, if you chose to delete or otherwise stop the operation of your registered app/website, you agree and acknowledge that Pollfish shall not proceed to any payment of fees referring to the time period between the last payment you received from Pollfish and the date of deletion of your app/website.

### 7\. User Incentivisation 

If you decide to set money rewards in order to incentivize your user to complete surveys, please have the following in mind: 
Calculation of Publisher fees and related payments made by Pollfish to the Publisher, are always based on the completed survey reports, as reported to Pollfish through the server-to-server callbacks. 

Server-to-server callbacks, being the standard industry practice for implementing user-rewarding policies in monetization networks,  is also the only 100% secure and accurate way to reward your own users in case you decide to do so. All other reports or analytics you may be collecting may be vulnerable to user fraud, false code implementation, false counting of analytics and several other errors. Therefore, we strongly suggest that calculation of due payments owed to your own users, as a result of a money rewarding policy set by you in order to incentivize your app users, is always based on the completed survey reports, as reported by our servers through the secure callbacks. Pollfish server to server option is available on the Pollfish dashboard and can be used at your convenience.

### 8\. Privacy

Pollfish only collects Registration and app/website information about you and your app/website.
