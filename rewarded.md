With Pollfish you are allowed to incentivize/reward users for completing a survey. Rewarding users for completing surveys is a great approach since it increases engagemenent and retention in an app.

Pollfish surveys are a great option for the rewarded approach:
------
**a) High Payouts** - A CPA Model where action is completed survey. Payments for completed survey on the Basic survey format start from $0.30 per completed and can end up to several dollars

**b) Users stays always within the app** - Users are incentivized to complete a survey from within the app. Survey procedure is executed through the app enviroment (Since everything is displayed as an ovrlay) so user never engages outside the app. Once a survey is completed surveys dissapear from the app and user continues with thecurrent flow of the app.

**c) Full transparency** - Pollfish SDK provides all necessary notifications from within the SDK to inform the publisher in code when a survey is received and how much money to be earned upon completion prior the publisher prompt the user. This way a publisher can make a decision if it worths to bother users based on monety to be earned. Pollfish notifications provide the exact pricing avoiding providing estimations on pricing. Furhter more, Pollfish SDK provides notifications on survey completion to inform publisher on how much were earned in order to credit the user.

**d) Enchansed security** - Pollfish provides secured server-to-server callbacks on survey completion to inform instantly a publisher if a survey was completed through an app.
