</p>

* <b>Playful Surveys</b> are small one-pager image question surveys (3-4 questions) that have a fluctuating price. On average they pay around $0.11 per completed. The interesting thing with this survey format is that when a user answers a question he can see what other people answered. A lot of people answer questions just to see what other people said and this increases conversion rates and eventually, the money a publisher makes.</b>
